title: "Instructor Notes"
---

## Introduction

- We recommend the usage of [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org) (formerly called CodiMD).
  All instructors can use it for note-taking when preparing or teaching this lesson and we also encourage
  its usage during the workshop for asking questions and collaborate during exercises, especially when using breakout rooms.
  The main advantage is that it uses Markdown so it can easily convince learners on the importance of learning Markdown.
  Make use of [HackMD Mechanics](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/#basic-controls) from [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/): it is important everyone understands how to use HedgeDoc from the very beginning of the workshop.
- When mulitple instructors are teaching this lesson,
  the person who demonstrates creating a repository
  (at the end of the Introduction) should remember to add the
  other instructors as collaborators on that repository.
  This will save you trying to mainatin consistency between
  multiple demo repositories while also handling questions,
  helping people who are stuck, etc.
- When demonstrating "Hello World in HTML,"
  you may choose to write the example HTML in a text editor
  before viewing the saved file in a browser.
  Or you may prefer to write the HTML directly into the workshop HedgeDoc/CodiMD,
  which will provide immediate visual feedback on the rendered equivalent.
  The advantage to using the workshop CodiMD is that it reduces the
  need to switch between so many windows and introduce the text editor.
  The advantage of opening a plain `.html` file in the browser is that it
  clearly demonstrates the utility of the `title` element.
