Jekyll has an extensive theme system that allows website designers to create community-maintained templates and styles 
that can be reused to customise your website. Jekyll themes specify and package up various bits of a website such as 
assets (e.g. CSS, Javascript files), layouts, includes, and stylesheets in a way that can be inherited and overridden by your siteâ€™s 
specific content.
